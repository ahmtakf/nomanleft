  This repository is for the project of CS319 course. In our project we will implement Walls & Warriors board game to PC environment. The purpose of game is completing different puzzle configurations. On each challenge player has to place different shaped walls on the board in such a way that all blue knights and tower will been inside the castle.
  Our implementation have many expansions and changes over the original one. A major difference is beside the original challange solving mode, there will be time trial mode where player will solve as many puzzle as he/she can against time and a sandbox mode where player can design he/she's own challenge and then play it. Alongside the new mods, original gameplay's challenge design will be expanded as well. Different landforms such as hills or lava pits and variet of characters with distinct attributes such as giant which covers two unit ground, battering-rams that requires more unit of walls to complete will save gameplay from monotony by enforcing player to think new ways of solving the puzzle. 
  A set of boosters will be available player's aid to complete the challenge rather easily. Each level completion will include some gold reward so that player chan refill boosters from the shop ones they finish. Beside the gold, depending on the number of steps taken towards the completion, a level can be completed with up to three stars, which shows player's puzzle solving skills.
  Many other minor diffirences which will be explained in requirement elicitation report, will be included as well.
